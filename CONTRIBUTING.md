# How to contribute

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1::tada:

Here are some important resources:

-   The [roadmap](https://github.com/vishnuraghavb/EnRecipes/projects/1) will tell you whats the future of EnRecipes
-   You can help [translate](https://github.com/vishnuraghavb/EnRecipes/projects/2) EnRecipes in your native language(not limited to those existing in the `To do`)
-   Bugs, suggestions or feedback? You can [create an issue here](https://github.com/vishnuraghavb/EnRecipes/issues) or [join the Telegram group](http://t.me/enrecipes)(quicker replies) to make the app better.

### Instruction for translators

1.  Fork this repository and head to the `app/i18n` folder.
2.  Create a new JSON file or duplicate any existing file and start translating its values.
3.  The filename should be based on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/vishnuraghavb/bf27b068acc35e331adfba66d18e2094).
4.  Once done, create a new pull request.

#### Don't know what fork means? No issues.

1.  Just [download the JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishnuraghavb/EnRecipes/main/app/i18n/en.default.json) and start translating its value(right side part after the colon":").
2.  Once done, share the file to the [EnRecipes Telegram group](http://t.me/enrecipes) or email it to apps@vishnuraghav.com for verification.

If everything looks good, your translations will be included in the next update and you'll be added to the contributors list for your work.
