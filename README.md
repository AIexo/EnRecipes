### Instruction for translators

You can contribute by translating EnRecipes in your native language.

1.  Fork this repository and head to the `app/i18n` folder.
2.  Create a new JSON file or duplicate any existing file and start translating its values.
3.  The filenames should be based on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/vishnuraghavb/bf27b068acc35e331adfba66d18e2094).
4.  Once done, create a new pull request.

#### Don't know what fork means? No issues.

1.  Just [download the JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishnuraghavb/EnRecipes/main/app/i18n/en.default.json) and start translating its value(right side part after the colon":").
2.  Once done, share the file to the [EnRecipes Telegram group](http://t.me/enrecipes) for verification.

If everything looks good, your translations will be included in the next update and you'll be added to the contributors list for your work.
